### Camera Distribution Details

#### s3_all - Multi-View Performance (38 cameras)
Available cameras: 00, 01, 03, 04, 05, 07, 09, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29, 31, 32, 33, 35, 37, 39, 40, 41, 43, 45, 47, 48, 49, 53, 55, 57, 59

**Identical to subject 0018's s3_all cameras**

#### Other Performances (s1, s2, s4, s5, s6)
- **Only camera 25 has data** - consistent across all subjects
- Single viewpoint for speech data
- Camera 25 confirmed as the primary/central camera

## Performance Statistics

| Performance | Frames | Size (GB) | Images | Audio | Calibration |
|------------|--------|-----------|--------|-------|-------------|
| s1_all | 1,168 | 0.56 | ✓ (cam_25) | ✓ | ✓ |
| s2_all | 1,136 | 0.54 | ✓ (cam_25) | ✓ | ✓ |
| s3_all | 754 | 12.21 | ✓ (38 cams) | ✓ | ✓ |
| s4_all | 1,063 | 0.53 | ✓ (cam_25) | ✓ | ✓ |
| s5_all | 1,209 | 0.53 | ✓ (cam_25) | ✓ | ✓ |
| s6_all | 778 | 0.34 | ✓ (cam_25) | ✓ | ✓ |

## Key Observations

### 1. Pattern Confirmation
- **Camera availability is consistent across subjects**
- s3_all is definitively the multi-view performance
- Camera 25 is the standard single-view camera

### 2. Frame Count Variations
- Frame counts vary between subjects (different speech lengths)
- s3_all has fewer frames than other performances
- Total frames: 6,108 across all performances

### 3. Storage Efficiency
- Multi-view s3_all: 12.21 GB (81% of total)
- Single-view performances: 0.34-0.56 GB each
- Total storage: 14.71 GB (vs 12.07 GB for 0018)

## Comparison with Subject 0018

| Metric | 0018 | 0019 | Difference |
|--------|------|------|------------|
| Total Size | 12.07 GB | 14.71 GB | +22% |
| s3_all Size | 8.99 GB | 12.21 GB | +36% |
| Gender | Male | Female | - |
| Age | 27 | 22 | -5 years |
| Height | 182 cm | 173 cm | -9 cm |

## Implications for Pipeline

### Confirmed Patterns
1. **Camera 25 is universal** for single-view performances
2. **s3_all always has 38 cameras** for multi-view
3. **Same 22 cameras missing** across all subjects

### Optimization Opportunities
1. Can safely extract only camera 25 for s1, s2, s4, s5, s6
2. Can define fixed 38-camera list for s3_all
3. No need for dynamic camera detection per subject

## Recommendations

### For Immediate Processing
- **Single-view extraction**: Only extract camera 25 for s1, s2, s4, s5, s6
- **Multi-view extraction**: Use fixed list of 38 cameras for s3_all
- **Skip camera detection**: Pattern is consistent, no need for dynamic detection

### For Full Dataset
- Expect ~15-20 GB per subject
- s3_all will consume 80-85% of storage
- Camera patterns should remain consistent

## Technical Notes

### Extraction Performance
- Extraction completed without errors
- Dynamic camera detection worked correctly
- All modalities extracted successfully

### Data Quality
- All audio files complete
- Image quality consistent
- Metadata accurate
